# RestaurantReviewProject
This is a project to convert a pre-designed website into a responsive design that implements accessibility features in the site HTML(genereted by JavaScript) Steps to complete are: 1.Fork and clone the starter repository. The code in this repository(https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) will serve as your baseline to begin development. 2. You'll need your own Google Maps API key. Replace the text YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY on line 37 of index.html with your own key. 3. Convert the provided site to use a responsive design . a. Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks should not be used; all responsiveness should be done with CSS. b)Use appropriate document type declaration and viewport tags c)Create a responsive grid-based layout using CSS d)Use media queries that provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes e)Use responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device 4. Implement accessibility features in the site HTML (most of this HTML is generated by JavaScript functions). 5. Add a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline. Only caching needs to be implemented, no other ServiceWorker features.
